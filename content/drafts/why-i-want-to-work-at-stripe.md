## Structure

- **What attracted me to Stripe** - Works in Progress, Stripe Press, and mission of the company. The side projects outside of the core of the company speak to the unabashedly optimistic company and culture. I attended the Works and progress launch event and was struct by that attitude in the founder of works in progress welcome speech
- **why am I a good fit** - strong data and analytics skills, interest in finance and particularly financial data, and a strong problem solver and understanding quickly how various data and complex financial transaction systems work (example medical claim adjudication systems)
- **What I hope to learn** - excited about working for the writing focused culture, want to stay connected and involved in the tech versus continue down the consulting and professional manager path, and I want to work for a company that has a modern tech stack versus working with legacy systems
